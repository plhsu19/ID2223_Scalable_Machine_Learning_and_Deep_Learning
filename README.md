labs and projects of KTH ID2223 "Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning"

Lab 1: In this lab assignment I practice the basics of regression and classification in Spark
Lab 2: In this lab assignment I use TensorFlow/Keras to do the image classification with CNN
Final Projecy: In this project I  build a RNN(LSTM) model that recognizes toxicity in online comments and minimizes unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities that are frequently attacked.
