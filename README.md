labs and projects of KTH ID2223 "Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning"

Lab 1: In the first part of this lab, we built a prediction model for housing price by using four different regression models(linear/ decision tree/ random forest/ gradient-booster forest regressions) in Spark. In the second part we are asked to carry out some exploratory analysis of attributes of credit card clients, and train a binary classification model to predict the risk of "default" of clients.
  
Lab 2: In this lab assignment we built an image classification model with Google Inception-v1 architecture(CNN model) by using TensorFlow/Keras.  
  
Final Project: we built a toxicity model with LSTM(RNN) structure that is able to detect toxic online comments by using TensorFlow/Keras. In addition, this model minimizes unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities that are frequently attacked in online communities.
