## ID2223_Scalable_Machine_Learning_and_Deep_Learning
Labs and final project of KTH ID2223 "Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning"

### Lab 1
In the first part of this lab, I built models to predict housing price by using four different regression models(linear/ decision tree/ random forest/ gradient-booster forest regressions) in Spark. In the second part I was asked to carry out some exploratory analysis of attributes of credit card clients, and train a binary classification model to predict the risk of "default" of these clients. I also compared the performance of classifiers based on different models, i.e., logistic regression, decision tree and random forest tree, and adopted cross validation(hyperparameter tuning) to improve the model.
  
### Lab 2
In this lab assignment I built an image classification model with Inception-v1 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by using frameworks TensorFlow/Keras.  
  
### Final Project
I built a toxicity model with LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is able to detect toxic online comments by using TensorFlow/Keras. In addition, this model minimizes unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities that are frequently attacked in online communities.

### How to use
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipnb) in each file
