## ID2223_Scalable_Machine_Learning_and_Deep_Learning
Labs and Final Project of KTH course ID2223 "Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning."

### Lab 1
In the first part of this lab, I built the pipelines to pre-process the data (cleaning, scaling, feature engineering, etc.) using the cluster-computing framework Apache Spark in Scala. I built machine learning/statistical models based on the pre-processed dataset to predict housing prices using four different regression models(linear/ decision tree/ random forest/ gradient-booster forest regressions). In the second part, I was asked to carry out exploratory analysis of credit card clients' attributes, pre-process the data,  and train binary classification models to predict the risk of "default" of these clients using Spark. I also compared classifiers' performance based on different models, i.e., logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest tree, and adopted cross-validation based hyperparameter tuning to improve the model.
  
### Lab 2
In this lab assignment, I built an image classification model with Inception-v1 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by using frameworks TensorFlow/Keras.  
  
### Final Project
I built a toxicity model with LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect toxic online comments by using TensorFlow/Keras. Besides, this model minimizes unintended bias concerning mentions of identities that are frequently attacked in online communities.

### How to use
1. Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) in each directory.
