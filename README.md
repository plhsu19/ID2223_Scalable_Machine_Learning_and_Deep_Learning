# ID2223_Scalable_Machine_Learning_and_Deep_Learning
labs and final project of KTH ID2223 "Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning"

Lab 1: In the first part of this lab, we built models to predict housing price by using four different regression models(linear/ decision tree/ random forest/ gradient-booster forest regressions) in Spark. In the second part we were asked to carry out some exploratory analysis of attributes of credit card clients, and train a binary classification model to predict the risk of "default" of these clients. We also compared the performance of classifiers based on different models, i.e., logistic regression, decision tree and random forest tree, and adopted cross validation(hyperparameter tuning) to improve the model.
  
Lab 2: In this lab assignment we built an image classification model with Google Inception-v1 architecture(CNN model) by using TensorFlow/Keras.  
  
Final Project: we built a toxicity model with LSTM(RNN) structure that is able to detect toxic online comments by using TensorFlow/Keras. In addition, this model minimizes unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities that are frequently attacked in online communities.
